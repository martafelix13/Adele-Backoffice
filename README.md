## Getting Started (Deployment)

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Adele-Backoffice.git
    cd Adele-Backoffice
    ```

2. **Build and start all services:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

3. **Access the app:**
    - Frontend: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
    - Backend API: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:5000)
    These are the pre-defined user accounts available after deployment. Each role has specific authorizations:

    | Role              |  Username | Authorizations                                      |
    |-------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
    | ADMIN             |  admin    | Full access: manage users, settings, and all data   |
    | TRE-OPERATOR      |  operator | Manage staff, view reports, limited admin features  |
    | OUTPUT-VALIDATOR  | validator | Basic access: view and update own data              |

     Passwords are securely hashed in the database. Default passwords are:
     - admin: admin123
     - manager: manager123
     - user: user123
     Change passwords in production for security.
