# Adele Backoffice â€“ Full Stack Application

This project is a containerized full-stack web application built with:

- **Angular** (Frontend)
- **Flask** (Backend)
- **MongoDB** (Database)
- **Docker Compose** (Orchestration)

---

## Getting Started (Deployment)

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Adele-Backoffice.git
    cd Adele-Backoffice
    ```


2. **Build and start all services:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

    > **Note:**
    > If the build fails for the frontend with an error about the Angular `dist` folder not being created, you should:
    > 1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `backoffice-tre` or `TRE-BIODATA` folder:
    >    ```bash
    >    cd Adele-Backoffice/backoffice-tre
    >    npm install
    >    npm run build
    >    cd ../../
    >    ```
    >    ```bash
    >    cd Adele-Website/TRE-BIODATA
    >    npm install
    >    npm run build
    >    cd ../../
    >    ```
    > 2. After a successful build, try running `docker compose up --build` again.
    > This will ensure the Angular build output exists for the container build process.

3. **Access the app:**
    - Frontend: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
    - Backend API: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:5000)
    These are the pre-defined user accounts available after deployment. Each role has specific authorizations:

    | Role              |  Username | Authorizations                                      |
    |-------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
    | ADMIN             |  admin    | Full access: manage users, settings, and all data   |
    | TRE-OPERATOR      |  operator | Manage staff, view reports, limited admin features  |
    | OUTPUT-VALIDATOR  | validator | Basic access: view and update own data              |

     Passwords are securely hashed in the database. Default passwords are:
     - admin: admin123
     - manager: manager123
     - user: user123
     Change passwords in production for security.
